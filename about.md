### My name's Graham Esau, I live in England and I tell computers to do things.

My day job involves a lot of C# (both .NET Framework and .NET Core), but also gives me the opportunity to work with a wide variety of other technologies. In my free time, I've been enjoying working with rust recently - you'll find a few of my personal projects on my [GitHub](https://github.com/GREsau/).
